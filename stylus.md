Stylus

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

A stylus enables artists, builders, and creators to express themselves using
precise input and expansive canvases. Pressure sensitivity and low latency allow
highly responsive interactions. Intuitive content management through drag and
drop provides a premium usability experience.

Interact with the app using a stylus as follows:

As you draw, observe the latency between the current stylus position and the last rendered stroke.

Draw with varying amounts of stylus pressure. Check whether the width of the strokes changes as the pressure changes. More pressure should produce thicker strokes.

Tilt the stylus as you draw; shading strokes should be produced. The more the stylus is tilted, the wider and lighter the shading strokes should be.

Let your fingers and palm touch the screen as you draw. The finger and palm touches shouldn't produce marks.
