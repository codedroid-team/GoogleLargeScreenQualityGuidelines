Responsive_adaptive_layouts

T-Layout_Flow

App has responsive and adaptive layouts designed for all screen sizes. All layouts are responsive (see
Migrate your UI to responsive layouts
). Implementation of adaptive layouts is determined by
window size classes
.

The app UI can include the following:

Leading‑edge navigation rails that expand on larger window sizes into full navigation panels

Grid layouts that scale the number of columns to accommodate window size changes

Columns of text on large screens

Trailing‑edge panels that are open by default on desktop screen sizes; closed, on smaller screens

Create multi-pane layouts (where appropriate) to take advantage of large screen space. See
Canonical layouts
.

Activity embedding
enables activity-based apps to create multi‑pane layouts by displaying activities side by side.

UI_Secondary_Elements

T-Layout_Flow

Modals, context menus, and other secondary elements are properly formatted on all screen types and device states, for example:

Bottom sheets are not full width on large screens. (Apply a maximum width to avoid stretching.) See
Behavior
in
Sheets: bottom
.

Buttons are not full width on large screens. See
Behavior
in
Buttons
.

Text fields and boxes don't stretch to full width on large screens. See
Behavior
in
Text fields
.

Small edit menus or modals don't cover the entire screen and maintain context for the user as much as possible. See
Menus
.

Context menus appear next to the item the user selected. See the "Context menus" topic in
Menus
.

Navigation rails replace navigation bars for better ergonomics on large screens. See
Navigation rail
.

Navigation drawers are updated to expanded navigation rails. See
Navigation drawer
.

Dialog boxes are updated to the latest material component. See
Dialogs
.

Images are displayed at a proper resolution and are not stretched or cropped.

Touch_Targets

T-Touch_Targets

Touch targets are least 48dp. See the Material Design
Layout and typography
guidelines.

Drawable_Focus

T-Drawable_Focus

A focused state is created for custom drawables that are interactive. A custom drawable is any visual UI element not provided by the Android framework. If users can interact with a custom drawable, the drawable must be focusable when the device is not in
Touch Mode
, and a visual indication of the focused state must be apparent.

Keyboard_Navigation

T-Keyboard_Navigation

The main task flows in the app support keyboard navigation, including
Tab
and arrow key navigation. See
Build more accessible apps
.

Keyboard_Shortcuts

T-Keyboard_Shortcuts

App supports keyboard shortcuts for commonly used actions such as select, cut, copy, paste, undo, and redo. See
Input compatibility
.

Keyboard_Media_Playback

T-Keyboard_Media_Playback

Keyboard can be used to control media playback; for example, the
Spacebar
plays and pauses media.

Keyboard_Send

T-Keyboard_Send

Keyboard
Enter
key performs a
send
function in communication apps.

Keyboard_Exit

T-Keyboard_Exit

Keyboard
Esc
key performs an
exit
function that terminates or undoes an action, for example:

Closes modals, dialogs, pop-ups, and menus

Clears search text or removes search focus

Cancels keyboard focus

Exits full-screen video, PiP, full-screen mode, or slideshows

Dismisses on-screen controls, such as progress bars, or menus

Cancels Up Next / autoplay timers

Deselects all selected items

Aborts renaming/editing without saving

Exits cropping/transform tools and discards changes

Context_Menus

T-Context_Menus

Context menus are accessible by typical mouse and trackpad right‑click (secondary mouse button or secondary tap) behavior.

Content_Zoom

T-Content_Zoom

App content can be zoomed using the mouse scroll wheel (in conjunction with pressing the
Control
, or
Ctrl
, key) and trackpad pinch gestures.

Hover_States

T-Hover_States

Actionable UI elements have hover states (where appropriate) to indicate to mouse and trackpad users that the elements are interactive.

Tests

To ensure your app is optimized and responsive to all display configurations,
perform the following tests.

Description

T-Layout_Flow

Responsive_adaptive_layouts
,
UI_Secondary_Elements

Run the app on devices that have a wide variety of screen sizes, including phones, foldable phones, small and large tablets, and desktop devices. Run the app in multi-window mode on the devices.

Verify that the app layout responds and adapts to different screen and window sizes. Check whether the app expands and contracts navigation rails, scales the number of columns in grid layouts, flows text into columns, and so forth. Observe whether UI elements are formatted for both aesthetics and function.

For apps using activity embedding, test whether activities are displayed side by side on large screens, stacked on small screens.

T-Touch_Targets

Touch_Targets

Verify that touch targets maintain a consistent, accessible size and position and are not hidden or obscured by other UI elements for all display sizes and configurations. For information on accessibility, see the
Accessibility Scanner
.

T-Drawable_Focus

Drawable_Focus

On each app screen that contains an interactive custom drawable, verify that the drawable can be focused using an external keyboard, D‑pad, or other device that enables UI elements to be focused. Verify that a visual indication of the focused state is apparent. For related information, see
Touch Mode
.
